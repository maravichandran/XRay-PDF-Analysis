# X-Ray PDF Analysis

The goal of this project was to use X-Ray PDF analysis to determine the effects of sulfate (sodium, magnesium, sulfuric acid) on the atomic structure of alkali-activated, eco-friendly cement. 

This file takes in the folder containing the variety of data files outputted by the Pair distribution function (PDF) analysis. It outputs a variety of PDF and SQ plots (X-ray diffraction) plots.
